## Overview

In this project, I am tasked to help Rosa, who is a microbiological researcher. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef to find bacteria that can be used to create a synthetic beef substitute. Rosa believes that the ideal bacteria which can be used to make synthetic beef can be found in a person's bellybutton. To test her hypothesis, she has sampled the navels of people acroos the country to identify bacterial species that colonize peoples' belly buttons. The identity of everyone is kept anonymous and they are assigned an ID number. My task is to make an interactive dashbaord so that the study participants can visit the website, select their ID number, and find which bacterial species are present in their navels. 


For my analysis, I use Javascript's Plotly library to plot data from external files and/or web-sources into  bar, pie and bubble charts.
